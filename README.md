# AutoSave-External
An autosave Java external for pre Max7 programs

<h2>Purpose: </h2>
I have a template of this feature that uses several objects but I wanted to see if I could make an external that would do the same thing. I chose Java since the external will be compatiable with Mac and Windows (according to the docs).  <br>

<h2>Use: </h2>
There two ways to use the external.  
You can use you attached template autoSave.maxpat <br>
You can create a new object <i>mxj autoSave</i> at any point <br>
For either you need to do the following.<br><br>

Place <i><str>autoSave.class</str></i> and <i><str>autoSave.java</str></i> in the classes folder:<br>
    Cycling '74 > java > classes<br>
  
If you opt for option 1 then you will need to place the autoSave.maxpat in the templates folder within the Cycling '74 folder. <br>
    Cycling '74 > patches > templates
