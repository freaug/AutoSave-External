# AutoSave-External
An autosave Java external for pre Max7 programs

I have a template of this feature that uses several objects but I wanted to see if I could make an external that would do the same thing. I chose Java since the external will be compatiable with Mac and Windows (according to the docs).  

There two ways to use the external.  
  • You can use you attached template autoSave.maxpat 
  • You can create a new object <i>mxj autoSave</i> at any point 
  
If you opt for option 1 then you will need to place the autoSave.maxpat in the templates folder within the Cycling '74 folder.  
  • Cycling '74 > patches > templates
